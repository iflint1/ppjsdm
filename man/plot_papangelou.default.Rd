\arguments{
\item{window}{Observation window. Preferably a \code{ppjsdm} Window, such as \code{ppjsdm::Rectangle_window}, but also accepts \code{spatstat} \code{im} or \code{owin} objects.}

\item{type}{Type of the point at which to evaluate the Papangelou conditional intensity. Either an integer representing the index of the type, or a string representing its label.}

\item{mark}{Mark of the point.}

\item{configuration}{Configuration of points at which to evaluate the Papangelou conditional intensity.}

\item{alpha}{Matrix of short-range interaction coefficients.}

\item{gamma}{Matrix of medium-range interaction coefficients.}

\item{beta0}{Vector representing the intercept.}

\item{covariates}{List of covariates. These are converted to the \code{im} format by applying \code{as.im} to all elements in the list.}

\item{beta}{Fitted regression coefficients with respect to covariates.}

\item{short_range}{Symmetric matrix of short-range interaction radii. Can also be a list of matrices, each entry representing a different potential.}

\item{medium_range}{Symmetric matrix of medium-range interaction radii.}

\item{long_range}{Symmetric matrix of long-range interaction radii.}

\item{saturation}{Saturation parameter of the point process.}

\item{types}{Character vector, with entry i representing the name of type i.}

\item{model}{String representing the short-range model to use. The currently authorised models are obtained with a call to \code{show_short_range_models()}.}

\item{medium_range_model}{String representing the medium-range model to use. The currently authorised models are obtained with a call to \code{show_medium_range_models()}.}

\item{grid_steps}{Vector of length 2, representing the number of horizontal and vertical grid steps. If a single value is given, it is assumed that the dimensions are the same along both axes.}

\item{nthreads}{Maximum number of threads to use.}

\item{use_log}{Plot the logarithm of the Papangelou conditional intensity instead?}

\item{use_ggplot}{Use ggplot for fancier plot?}

\item{return_papangelou}{Should we return the Papangelou intensity as an \code{im} object instead of plotting it?}

\item{drop_type_from_configuration}{Should we remove the considered \code{type} from the configuration?}

\item{show}{In the plot, should we show all points, no points, or only the individuals of the configuration with certain types?
\code{show = "all"} shows all points, \code{show = "none"} shows no points, \code{show = "type"} shows only the focal type,
and \code{show} can otherwise be a vector of types, in which case all the corresponding types will be shown.}

\item{limits}{Limits for values of the Papangelou conditional intensity when plotting.}

\item{mark_range}{(Optional) Vector of length two, representing the range of sizes used when plotting points with different marks.}

\item{base_size}{Font size.}

\item{full_configuration}{(Optional) Configuration object, perhaps different from \code{configuration}, to overlay on the Papangelou conditional intensity.
This need not be the configuration used to compute the intensity, indeed, one might wanr to condition on some types, but show others on the final plot.}

\item{legend_title}{Title to give to the legend describing the conditional intensity.}

\item{type_description}{Name to give the types in the legend (e.g., "species" or "classes").}

\item{mark_description}{Name to give the marks in the legend (e.g., "size" or "DBH").}

\item{types_order}{(Optional) Order of the types in figure legend. Vector of the names of types to plot, ordered in a given way.}

\item{colours}{(Optional) Colours to use when plotting points.}

\item{shapes}{(Optional) Shapes to use when plotting points.}

\item{...}{Ignored.}
