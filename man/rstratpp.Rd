\usage{
rstratpp(
  window = Rectangle_window(),
  delta_x = NULL,
  delta_y = NULL,
  nsim = 1,
  types = NULL,
  drop = TRUE,
  mark_range = c(1, 1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{window}{Observation window. Default is a Rectangle window \eqn{[0, 1]^2}. Preferably a `ppjsdm` Window, such as `ppjsdm::Rectangle_window`, but also accepts `spatstat` `im` or `owin` objects.}

\item{delta_x}{A vector representing the distance between tiles along the x axis, for each type.
Default is a vector of same size as types, filled with ones.}

\item{delta_y}{A vector representing the distance between tiles along the y axis, for each type.
Default is to set it to delta_x}

\item{nsim}{Number of samples to generate. Default is 1.}

\item{types}{Types of the points. Default is a vector (type1, type2, ...) of same size as n.}

\item{drop}{If nsim = 1 and drop = TRUE, the result will be a Configuration, rather than a list containing a Configuration.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{mark_range}{Range of additional marks to give to the points.}
