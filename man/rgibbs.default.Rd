\arguments{
\item{window}{Observation window. Preferably a \code{ppjsdm} Window, such as \code{ppjsdm::Rectangle_window}, but also accepts \code{spatstat} \code{im} or \code{owin} objects.}

\item{alpha}{Repulsion matrix. Default is a square matrix of same size as types, filled with zeroes.}

\item{gamma}{Medium range repulsion matrix. Default is a square matrix of same size as types, filled with zeroes.}

\item{beta0}{A vector representing the log_intensities of the point processes.
Default is a vector of same size as types, filled with zeros}

\item{covariates}{Covariates, with an empty list as a default.}

\item{beta}{Fitted coefficients related to covariates. Default is square matrix of zeroes of the same
number of rows/columns as the covariates.}

\item{short_range}{Symmetric matrix of short range interaction radii. Filled with 0.1 by default.}

\item{medium_range}{Symmetric matrix of medium range interaction radii. Filled with 0 by default.}

\item{long_range}{Symmetric matrix of long range interaction radii. Filled with 0 by default.}

\item{saturation}{Saturation parameter of the point process. Default is 2.}

\item{types}{Types of the points. Default is a vector (type1, type2, ...) of same size as n.}

\item{model}{String representing the model to use You can check the currently authorised models with a call to \code{show_short_range_models()}.}

\item{medium_range_model}{String representing the model to use You can check the currently authorised models with a call to \code{show_medium_range_models()}.}

\item{steps}{Number of steps in the Metropolis algorithm. If \code{steps = 0}, uses the coupling from the past algorithm instead.
Default is 0.}

\item{nsim}{Number of samples to generate. Default is 1.}

\item{drop}{If nsim = 1 and drop = TRUE, the result will be a Configuration, rather than a list containing a Configuration. Default is TRUE.}

\item{mark_range}{Range of additional marks to give to the points.}

\item{only_simulate_these_types}{Parameter used to do conditional simulation, only drawing from some of the types (usually conditional upon the others).}

\item{conditional_configuration}{Simulate conditional on this configuration.}

\item{starting_configuration}{Optional configuration to start with when using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (steps > 0).}

\item{nthreads}{Number of threads to use. Default is 1.}

\item{debug}{Output debugging information (current only used with Metropolis-Hastings)?}

\item{...}{Not used.}
