\title{Calculate the matrix G2 used to compute the Variance-Covariance Matrix for a Fitted Gibbs point process.
The function can be supplied multiple fits, in which case the aggregate estimator is computed.
This is an internal function used when you want to compute the vcov matrix in multiple steps (useful for large datasets).}
