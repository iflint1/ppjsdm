\title{Calculate the matrix A1 used to compute the Variance-Covariance Matrix for a Fitted Gibbs point process.
The function can be supplied multiple fits, in which case the aggregate estimator is computed.
This function is used to compute the vcov matrix in multiple steps (useful for large datasets).}
